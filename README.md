# pico_library

 This is a collection of files used in Raspberry Pi Pico developemnt. 

The folder e_ink_weather uses a weather api to display some weather details including current weather and a 3-day forecast.


The weather_sensor folder is another weather app but this time reading data from a local sensor.
